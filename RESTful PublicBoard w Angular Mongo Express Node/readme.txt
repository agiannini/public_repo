This application was made with the MEAN stack.

To generate and modify the database, it uses a REST api built in express.

The client folder holds the Angular application.

The server folder contains the Express/Mongo application which calls the dist folder inside 'client'.

To run application, install all dependencies, compile application with ng build and run express server. The application will automatically run on port 8080.
