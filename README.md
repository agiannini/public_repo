Thank you for visiting! My name is Alex Giannini. I just graduated from Harvard University's Extension School
 with an Bachelors of Liberal Arts, Field: Computer Science Minor: Math.
I am looking for work as a web developer in the New York City Area.

This respository contains a handful of projects that are meant to  demonstrate a knowledge of REST, security, databases and other full-stack principles. They are  not an exhaustive presentation of my 
skills. See them hosted at
