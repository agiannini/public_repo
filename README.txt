Thank you for visiting! My name is Alex Giannini. I just graduated from Harvard University Extension School with an Bachelors of Liberal Arts, Field: Computer Science Minor: Math. I am looking for work as a web developer in the New York City Area.

My github page contains a handful of projects that are meant to demonstrate a knowledge of REST, security, databases and other full-stack principles. They are not an exhaustive presentation of my skills. See them hosted at www.alex-g-portfolio.me.
